# evote
A simple electronic voting system built with php,bootstrap and mysql
I created this simple e-voting app using php 5.6.15
So I enjoy you to use this version or a higher version
Mind you,I haven't finish the development but I can bet you'll
always find this project useful
 
Download the zip file
unzip it to htdocs or www. folder
create database "vote"
import vote.sql
You can alter the variables at connection.php if need be.

Note 
Only the admin can add users
Users can only be added at the backend i.e users 
Voted candidates can be seen at the contestant sub database of vote database

Enjoy!!!
Proudly develop by Salako Moses O.
You can join me for research and group/team Software Development!!!
Cheers!!!
